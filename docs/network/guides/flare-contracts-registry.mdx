Flare provides a registry of enshrined protocol contracts such as `FtsoV2`, `FdcHub`, and `RandomNumberV2`.  
To ensure reliability, these contract addresses should **always be retrieved dynamically** via the **Flare Contract Registry** rather than hardcoding them.

Using the registry ensures your contracts and dApps remain functional through future protocol upgrades and are protected from interacting with incorrect or malicious contract addresses.
Hardcoding addresses, on the other hand, can cause your dApp to fail when contracts are updated or redeployed, and it also introduces security risks if an outdated or unverified address is used.

## `FlareContractRegistry` Address

The [`FlareContractRegistry`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry) smart contract is the **only trusted source** for resolving official protocol contract addresses.
The registry is deployed at the same address across all Flare networks:

<Tabs block>
  <TabItem value="flare" label="Flare Mainnet" default>
    <SolidityReference
      network="FlareMainnet"
      contractNames={contracts}
      renderAbi={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="coston2" label="Flare Testnet Coston2">
    <SolidityReference
      network="FlareTestnetCoston2"
      contractNames={contracts}
      renderAbi={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="songbird" label="Songbird Canary-Network">
    <SolidityReference
      network="SongbirdCanaryNetwork"
      contractNames={contracts}
      renderAbi={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="coston" label="Songbird Testnet Coston">
    <SolidityReference
      network="SongbirdTestnetCoston"
      contractNames={contracts}
      renderAbi={false}
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Retrieval Methods

The `RandomNumberFetcher.sol` contract, shown below, demonstrates how to retrieve the address of [`RandomNumberV2`](/network/solidity-reference/RandomNumberV2Interface) using three approaches.
Each approach is detailed ahead.

### Method 1: Hardcoding contract addresses ðŸ”´

The `getRandomNumberHardcoded` function, found within the `RandomNumberFetcher.sol` example presented earlier, uses a hardcoded address to create an interface instance.
This is **not recommended for production environments**.

:::danger

- Never hardcode contract addresses in production.
- Never use contract addresses obtained from unofficial sources like DMs, social media, or third-party websites.
- Instead of passing contract addresses directly into constructors, retrieve them dynamically, as shown below.

:::

### Method 2: Calling `FlareContractRegistry` directly

The Flare Contract Registry smart contract exposes [`getContractAddressByName`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getcontractaddressbyname) or [`getContractAddressByHash`](/network/solidity-reference/IFlareContractRegistry#getcontractaddressbyhash) to retrieve the address of the contract.

In the `RandomNumberFetcher.sol` example, the `getRandomNumberViaRegistryName` function uses the `getContractAddressByName` method to retrieve the address of `RandomNumberV2`.

### Method 3: Using `ContractRegistry` library

The [flare-periphery-contracts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flarenetwork/flare-periphery-contracts) package includes a helper utility [`ContractRegistry`](https://github.com/flare-foundation/flare-solidity-periphery-package-mirror/blob/master/flare/ContractRegistry.sol).
This library provides shorthand functions for accessing common protocol contracts, e.g., `ContractRegistry.getRandomNumberV2()`.

In the `RandomNumberFetcher.sol` example, the `getRandomNumberViaContractLibrary` function demonstrates this approach.

:::tip

If the contract you are looking for does not have a shorthand method in the `ContractRegistry` library, you can fall back to using [Method 2](#method-2-calling-flarecontractregistry-directly) to fetch the registered contracts.
